\title{Constructs a large matrix storing a pvalue for every split and a CI for every node.
Used as a precursor to plotting.}
\usage{
fullTreeInference(tree, sigma_y = sd(tree$model[, 1]), CI = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{An rpart object. Must have been built with rpart arguement "model=TRUE".}

\item{sigma_y}{The known error variance. If not provided, is estimated with a conservative guess.}

\item{CI}{A boolean. Would you like to compute confidence intervals in addition to pvalues? Confidence intervals are more
comutationally intensive, and so it may sometimes be desireable to set this to FALSE.}
}
\value{
A large matrix storing lots of pvalues and confidence intervals.
}

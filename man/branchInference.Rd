\title{This is the main function for carrying out inference on an \texttt{rpart} regression tree. This function can be used to
carry out the "inference on a pair of sibling regions" or the "efficient alternative inference on a single region" described in our paper.}
\usage{
branchInference(
  tree,
  branch,
  type = "reg",
  alpha = 0.05,
  sigma_y = NULL,
  c = 0,
  computeCI = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{An \texttt{rpart} object corresponding to the tree that you wish to do inference on. This tree must have been built
with \texttt{rpart} parameters \texttt{model=TRUE, maxcompete=0,maxsurrogate=0}.}

\item{branch}{A vector of splits describing the branch that you wish to do inference on. You should obtain this using the function
\texttt{getBranch()}. Must actually correspond to a branch in \texttt{tree}; otherwise, errors will occur.}

\item{type}{A string that should be set to either "reg" (default) or "sib". This specifies whether you are doing
inference on the mean of single region defined by the end of this branch ("reg"), or doing inference on the difference
between this region and its subling.}

\item{alpha}{The significance level for the confidence interval}

\item{sigma_y}{The true error variance. If known, this should be passed in. Otherwise, the sample variance will be computed
as a conservative estimate.}

\item{c}{The p-value c}

\item{computeCI}{Would you like a confidence interval to be computed? Confidence intervals are much slower to compute than
p-values, and so if you are performing simulations it may be wise to set this to false.}
}
\value{
An object of class \texttt{branch_inference} that contains a confidence interval, a p-value, 
the sample statistic, the conditioning set, and a flag reminding the user if type="reg" or type="sib".
